# Cat-Shelter-App

A simple application written using the React library. It is an imitation of a cat shelter. Cat-Shelter-App at its core shows the data of cats in the shelter (gender, age, name, information whether the cat likes children). The cat database has been simulated by an array of objects. This application is also designed to search for the cat by its name and it can show which cats like to live with the children. The filtering process has a live search effect.
